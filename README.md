## Hi there <img src=https://iam-weijie.github.io/wave/hand-emoji.svg width=30px>, I am Masego Mashishi!

A detail-oriented and motivated professional currently pursuing a career in software development. My journey began in administrative and operations roles, where I developed strong problem-solving, organizational, and communication skills that now form the foundation of my approach to tech.

Through the Digiata Software Development Scholarship with CodeSpace, I’ve been immersed in front-end and back-end programming, learning key technologies such as HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript. This experience has sparked a deep interest in how software can streamline processes, improve efficiency, and create real-world impact — especially within business and community-focused environments.

I’m passionate about building practical, user-centered solutions and continuously developing my skills to become a versatile and innovative developer. My career goal is to grow into a full-stack developer who not only writes clean, efficient code but also contributes to projects that solve meaningful problems and empower people through technology. 

## 🏆 Major Achievement

Awarded **1st place** for my innovative FoodLink MVP, recognized for addressing food insecurity through technology and community-driven solutions.
